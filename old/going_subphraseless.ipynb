    "# Going Subphraseless\n",
    "\n",
    "The current method for isolating phrase heads ([here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ETCBC/heads/blob/master/phrase_heads.ipynb)) requires strenuous and ineloquent processing of BHSA subphrase relations. The subphrases are not always consistently encoded and suffer from numerous exceptional cases. The result is that the method is rather convoluted and ineloquent.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will explore the possibility of disconnecting semantic head analysis from the ETCBC subphrase encoding. \n",
    "\n",
    "A \"semantic\" head is the primary content word of a phrase, following Croft's \"Primary Information Bearing Unit\":\n",
    "\n",
    "> **The noun and the verb are the PRIMARY INFORMATION_BEARING UNITS (PIBUs) of the phrase and clause respectively. In common parlance, they are the content words. PIBUs have major informational content that functional elements such as articles and [auxiliaries] do not have. (Croft, *Radical Construction Grammar*, 2001, 258; see also Shead, *Radical Frame Semantics and Biblical Hebrew*, 104)**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **A (semantic) head is the profile equivalent that is the primary information-bearing unit, that is, the most contentful item that most closely profiles the same kind of thing that the whole constituent profiles. (ibid., 259)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Croft also provides an additional criterion to \"profile equivalence\":\n",
    "\n",
    "> **If the criterion of profile equivalence produces two candidates for headhood, the less schematic meaning is the PIBU; that is, the PIBU is the one with the narrower extension, in the formal semantic sense of that term (ibid., 259)**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inquiry\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we isolate semantic phrase heads in BHSA using only the phrase_atom and phrase limits? This question indeed means that we  take the phrase_atom/phrase boundaries for granted. Empirically, the validity of BHSA phrase boundaries needs to be tested. But for now, the exercise of isolating semantic phrase heads could be seen as the first step towards reproducible phrase boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "A semantic head will most often stand in a syntactically independent position. For Hebrew nominal phrases, that essentially means a word which is not precided by a construct, and which is semantically central (excluding attributive slots (e.g. H + noun + H + ATTRIBUTIVE) or an adjectival slots (e.g. noun + noun as in אישׁ טוב).\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantifier expressions present unique cases, which may be syntactically independent but semantically secondary. These are expressed through specialized lexical items such as cardinal numbers and qualitative quantifiers (e.g.  \"כל\" and \"חצי\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Another complication is the use of nouns as prepositional items. Such uses can be seen with words like פני \"face\" such as לפני \"in front,\" and even words like ראשׁ as in ראשׁ החדשׁ \"beginning of the month.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Other expressions of quantity, quality, and function provide similar complexities. These cases have to be specified in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ambiguity\n",
    "\n",
    "Considerable ambiguity is present in several of cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "**`A B and C`**<br>\n",
    "Given A, B, C == nominal words. Is their relationship `A // B // C` or `A+B // C`. In other words: **what is the relationship of two adjacent nominal words given a list?** Is B a descriptor of A or is it an independent element? \n",
    "\n",
    "**`A of B and C`**<br>\n",
    "Is it, `(A of B) // (C)` or `(A of (B // C)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Or even:\n",
    "\n",
    "**`A of B C and D`**<br>\n",
    "This pattern combines elements from both ambiguous cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these ambiguities we will apply a battery of disambiguation attempts. Some of those attempts will draw from corpus data, i.e. do we ever see `B and C` with the conjunction explicitly elsewhere in the corpus? Or do we ever see a `A of C` excplicitly in the corpus? Accents may also play a role: do we see a conjunctive or disjunctive accent between `B C`? \n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of pre-defined word sets are needed for processing quantification and ambiguous adjacency. These sets are made available in the form of `wsets`, a dictionary containing word sets that are calculated in to the `wordsets` directory of this repository. The following wordsets have been defined:\n",
    "\n",
    "* nominals – a set of word nodes with parts of speech and participles that have the potential to function as nominalized elements. The selected parts of speech are quite permissive: `{'subs', 'nmpr', 'adjv', 'advb', 'prde', 'prps', 'prin', 'inrg'}`. Since parts of speech are not taken as universal linguistic categories but only summaries of language-specific word tendencies (cf. Croft, *Radical Construction Grammar*, 2001), we consider that almost any part of speech can be used in a nominal pattern (or construction). There are some upper limits to this assumption, though. For instance, we exclude cojunctions, articles, prepositions, and negators. \n",
    "* prepositions – a word set consisting of words with a part of speech category of `prep`, a lexical set (`ls`) feature of `ppre` (\"potential preposition\"), as well as a select group of nouns like פני \"face\" which have been processed for prepositionality. \n",
    "* quantifiers - consists of word nodes that are cardinal numbers or qualitative quantifiers such as כל.\n",
    "* mword – mapping from a word to its phonological word group (\"masoretic word\"); joins words on maqqeph and ø space\n",
    "* accent_type – a mapping from a word to its accent type: conjunctive or disjunctive\n",
    "* conj_pairs – a dict of observed conjunction pairings of lexemes in the corpus: `A & B`\n",
    "* cons_pairs – a dict of observed construct pairings of lexemes in the corpus: `A of B`\n",
    "* mom – mapping from word node to its mother word node for a specified relationship: `mom[A]['coord'] = B`\n",
    "* kid – opposite of mom; mapping from word to its children nodes for a relationship: `kid[A]['cons'] = B`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Let's get started**. We load the necessary functions and BHSA data (straight from source)."

    "## Chunk Constructions\n",
    "\n",
    "For now we have delimited a set of standard noun constructions. But there are many overlapping or incomplete constructions. For instance, a prepositional construction consisting of the following phrase (space-separated for accuracy):\n",
    "\n",
    "> ב ה יום\n",
    "\n",
    "The prepositional construction, as it stands, will only recognize the first word in front of the preposition, yielding the following construction:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ב ה\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason is because ה must **first** be united with its remaining elements. We need an **order of operations** to complete this procedure. That is, a list of global priorities that tells the chunker algorithm what parts to merge first. The beginning or ends of overlapping constructions can subsequently be used to link the parts together. For instance, not only do we have a preposition construction, we also have a definite construction which recognizes:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ה יום\n",
    "\n",
    "If the definite construction has priority over the preposition construction, the algorithm can gather all of the requisite pieces before placing it in relation to the preposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Set Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use set logic to determine when constructions overlap in their containing slots. Constructions that are wholly contained in another construction might also need to be abolished. That is the case with the attributive adjective construction for instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ה יום ה שׁבעי\n",
    "\n",
    "This construction already calls the definite construction as a condition for existence and contains it in its `slots` attribute. In this case, the algorithm should not create two separate instances of the definite constructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Build Constructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can make the chunks, we need to run the `NounConstructions` builder on the corpus. We do that below and store the resulting `Construction` objects in a phrase2construction mapping. This takes approximately 2 mins on a 2017 Macbook pro."
